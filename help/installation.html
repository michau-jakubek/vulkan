<h1>Installation</h1>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vulkan SDK</li>
  <li>GLFW library</li>
  <li>CMake</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>C++ compilers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prepare needed things:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download and install Vulkan SDK   - <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/">https://vulkan.lunarg.com/</a></li>
	<li>Download and install GLFW library - <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download">https://www.glfw.org/download</a></li>
	<li>Download and CMake build system   - <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">https://cmake.org/download/</a></li>
	<li>Install Git and Python the way you like it</li>
	<li>Install compilers. On Linux prefered g++ or clang++, on Windows the Visual Studio</li>
	<li>Download project from this site using: <font color="brown">git clone https://github.com/michau-jakubek/vulkan.git vtf</font>
		<a href="#" onClick="cp2clipboard();">(copy)</a></li>
	<li>Move to the newly created &quot;vtf&quot; folder of the project</li>
	<li>Inside &quot;vtf&quot; create a build folder (e.g. 'build') and go into</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a project or a solution:</h3>
<p>Creating a project is basically very simple. To create the project you need to run <code>cmake</code> tool
with several parameters. Beside the built-in <code>cmake</code>'s parameters e.g. <code>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</code>, this
tool needs to know where it should look for the project's dependencies, and these are the Vulkan library,
Vulkan headers, the GLFW library and its headers. To specify them to the <code>cmake</code> use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VULKAN_LIB_PATH     should point to the Vulkan link library</li>
    <li>VULKAN_INCLUDE_DIR  should point to the Vulkan include path</li>
    <li>GLFW3_LIB_PATH      should point to the GLFW v3 link library</li>
    <li>GLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR   should point to the GLFW v3 include path</li>
</ul>
For an example your command to create the project would look like:<br /><br />
    On Linux:
    <pre>
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DVULKAN_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/vulkan/1.3.204.1/x86_64/include \
                                   -DVULKAN_LIB_PATH=/opt/vulkan/1.3.204.1/x86_64/lib/libvulkan.so \
                                   -DGLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include \
                                   -DGLFW3_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglfw.so.3 ..
    </pre>
    On Windows:
    <pre>
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DVULKAN_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\\VulkanSDK\\1.3.216.0\\Include ^
                                     -DVULKAN_LIB_PATH=c:\\VulkanSDK\\1.3.216.0\\Lib\\vulkan-1.lib ^
                                     -DGLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR=c:\\VulkanDeps\\glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64\\include ^
                                     -DGLFW3_LIB_PATH=c:\\VulkanDeps\\glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64\\lib-vc2019\\glfw3.lib ..
    </pre>
Sometime typing this command is too tedious, so you can try other parameters:
<ul>
	<li>LOOK_FOR_VULKAN</li>
	<li>LOOK_FOR_GLFW3</li>
	<li>HINT_FOR_VULKAN</li>
	<li>HINT_FOR_GLFW3</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters started with LOOK_ should point to the folder where exists
both headers and library for the Vulkan and the GLFW3 respectively.
The <code>cmake</code> will first look for libraries, and if it finds any, it will
start searching for the headeers in the directory of the found library.
Sometime it may happen that found paths are ambigous, especially when
you have several versions of the SDK or the GLFW3 is in the same directory as the SDK.
To resolve these ambiguities you can use the remaining two parameter starting with HINT_.</p>
<p>The parameters started with HINT_ can take a comma-separated list of subfolders.
Let's consider your catalog structure on th Windows consists of more than one version
and it looks similar to this:</p>
<pre>
    c:\
     |
     +--- VulkanSDK\
           |
           +--- 1.3.231.1\
           |     |
           |     +--- Include\
           |     |     |
           |     |     +--- vulkan_core.h
           |     |
           |     +--- Lib\
           |     |     |
           |     |     +--- vulkan-1.lib
           |     |
           |     +--- Lib32\
           |           |
           |           +--- vulkan-1.lib
           |
           +--- 1.3.250.1\
                 |
                 +--- Include\
                 |     |
                 |     +--- vulkan_core.h
                 |
                 +--- Lib\
                 |     |
                 |     +--- vulkan-1.lib
                 |
                 +--- Lib32\
                       |
                       +--- vulkan-1.lib
</pre>
and you want to use <b>Lib32</b> from the latest version, then the <code>cmake</code>'s parameters would like look like:
<ul><li>-DLOOK_FOR_VULKAN=c:\VulkanSDK -DHINT_FOR_VULKAN=1.3.250.1,Lib32</li></ul>
The same rules are applied to the GLFW3.

<h3>Suggestion:</h3>
<p>Please note that the <code>cmake</code> likes to hold values passed to the variables between
subsequent calls in its cache, especially if you call it with different variables. Thus it is good
idea to enforce it to configure always fresh build tree by using the <b><i>--fresh</i></b> option.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the Windows OS is case insensitive. In the contrast, the Linux OS is case
sensitive, so be carefully while you pass folder or subfolder names to mentioned variables.</p>
