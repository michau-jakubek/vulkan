<h1>Building the executable</h1>
<p>After successful <a href="installation.html">installation</a> you can go to the building of the project.
There is no single and unificated method how to do this. For an example if you prefer work on the Windows
with Microsoft Visual Studio then it is enough that you will start the building process by clicking the
<code>build project</code> from its menu. The second thing is that the Visual Studio has its own settings
for the project type: Release and Debug, while under the Linux the project type is specified by some
parameters passed to the command line, i.a. <code>-ggdb</code>. On the Linux system(s) basically the most
convinient method is to go to the <code>cmake</code>'s binary dir and type <code>make</code> command.
Anyway, always you can also build the project using <code>cmake</code> only specifying the command:</p>
<ul><li>cmake --build <${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}> -j 8</li></ul>
<p>This approach is good because in the case of Microsoft Visual Studio you don't have to launch it at all.
You dont't have to specify any compilers manually, <code>cmake</code> will find a proper compiler and utilize it.
In the cited build command I used also <code>-j 8</code> parameter. It tells to the compiler how many threads
it will use to build your project. In the case of building from scratch under the Linux with <code>make</code>
you can also manipulate the number of running threads by specifying <code>make -j 8</code>.</p>
